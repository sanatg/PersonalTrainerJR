    <h2><strong>Did you know there are three body types?</strong></h2>
    <h5>Before getting into the names let's discuss what is the term body types!</h5>
    <h3><strong>Body types</strong></h3>
    <p> 
        Think about the people you know. Some may be tall and some may be short.
        Others may be slim or fuller in shape.
        The bottom line is that people come in all shapes and sizes.
        The physical makeup of one's body is called their body type.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lifestyle, level of fitness, and genetics all contribute to this.
        Three main body types have been defined: mesomorph, ectomorph, and endomorph. 
        Let's take a closer look, using examples.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
            Mesomorph
        </strong>
          </li> 
            Ally is a soccer player. Soccer requires a lot of running and agility. 
            She is strong and fit, and her body is tighter and more muscular than those of her friends. 
            Her shape is sort of square. Ally's body type would be described as a mesomorph.
        </ul> 
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>
                Ectomorph
            </strong>
            </li>
                Jacob likes to play video games. He is thin and slight in stature.
                He is noticeably slimmer than most of his male friends, 
                and he does not have a lot of muscle or body fat.
                His shape is kind of like a straight line.
               Jacob's body type would be defined as an ectomorph.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>
                Endomorph
            </strong>
            </li>
                Ally's brother Mike plays video games with Jacob. 
                Mike is bigger in size than Jacob, and has more body fat.
                He does not have a lot of muscle, and his skin is somewhat loose and flabby. 
                His shape might be described as round. Mike's body type is an endomorph.
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5> 
            <strong>So the question arises can we really change our body types?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
                Is it realistic for Mike and Jacob to decide that they want fit and muscular bodies, 
                like Abby's? Is it possible for Jacob to go from a wiry, thin person to a muscular person? 
                How about Mike? Can he go from chubby to ripped?
                <br>
                <br>
                Our unique body type is the result of several factors. Genetics,
                or the biological material we inherit from our mother and father,
                contributes to how we look. This means that to some degree,
                what we look like is probably going to resemble one or both parents. 
                (Though we can't increase or decrease our height, aside from wearing heels!).
                In short the answer in no,but to some extent yes by eating a balanced diet and 
                doing exercises and improving sleeping habits you can make your self from chubby to ripped
                to a certain extent.
