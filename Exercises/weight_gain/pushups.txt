Pushups

Pushups are simple and help build muscle in your arms and shoulders. To do a pushup:

Lie face down on the ground.
Put your hands on the ground, palms flat, with your arms out at your sides and your hands shoulder-width apart.
Slowly push your body up until your arms are fully extended. Keep your back and legs straight so that your body makes a straight line.
Slowly lower yourself back down until your nose nearly touches the floor.
Repeat as many times as you feel comfortable.
