Lunges
You can do this exercise anywhere. It’s great for bulking up and toning your leg and butt muscles.

Stand up straight, flexing your abdominal muscles.
Extend one leg like you’re taking a step, then lean forward like you’re kneeling until your knees are at 90-degree angles.
Push back on your heel to lift yourself back up to your initial position.
Repeat as many times as you feel comfortable on one leg.
Repeat for the other leg.
