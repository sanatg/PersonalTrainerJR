Pullups
You’ll need some kind of pullup bar or sturdy cylindrical object to do pullups. Otherwise, this exercise is a simple way to build arm and shoulder muscles.

Grip the pullup bar with both hands. Your palms should face away from you. Keep your arms shoulder-width apart.
Pull yourself up enough to hang off the bar so that your feet aren’t touching the ground and your arms are straight.
Continue to pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar.
Slowly lower yourself down so that your arms are straight again.
Repeat as many times as you want.
